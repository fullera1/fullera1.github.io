        <h2> JavaScript </h2>
        <p> JavaScript Basics and JavaScript Libraries</p>
        <p> JavaScript is used for page manipulation, written for page to interpret / able to interact/ listen to actions of user.
            HTML, CSS, and JavaScript form the major three languages used for the web.  
            <br>
            Items must occur between < script > < /script > .  
            Spacing and indentation don't matter, but every line must end in a semi-colon ;
            <br>
            Inside of the script tags: variables (var) var_NAMEOFVARIABLE_=_VALUE;
            In browser, see tab "Console" to manipulate the JavaScript on the page
            <br>
            JavaScript doesn't know paragraph-tags, so don't do it inside the script tags.
        </p>
<script> 
var myNumber = 42;
console.log(myNumber); 
    </script>
    <p> Look at the code, and look at Web Developer > Web Console.  See the 42? You defined myNumber as 42 and then called a function that made it log that variable in the console.  That's why the 42 is logged there.</p>

<script> myNumber = myNumber + 10
console.log(myNumber + 10)
</script>
<p> You can manipulate variables with math.
    <br>
    String Variables:
    </p>
<script> 
var username = "Annalee" 

var myNumber = 20;
var bigNumber = myNumber > 100;
console.log(bigNumber);
</script>
