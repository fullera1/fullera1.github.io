        <h2> JavaScript </h2>
        <p> JavaScript Basics and Libraries</p>
        <p> JavaScript is used for page manipulation, written for page to interpret / able to interact/ listen to actions of user.
            HTML, CSS, and JavaScript form the major three languages used for the web.  
            <br>
            Items must occur between < script > < /script > .  
            Spacing and indentation don't matter, but every line must end in a semi-colon ;
            <br>
            Inside of the script tags: variables (var) var_NAMEOFVARIABLE_=_VALUE;
            In browser, see tab "Console" to manipulate the JavaScript on the page
            <br>
            JavaScript doesn't know paragraph-tags, so don't do it inside the script tags.
        </p>
<script> 
var myNumber = 42;
console.log(myNumber); 
    </script>
    <p> Look at the code, and look at Web Developer > Web Console.  See the 42? You defined myNumber as 42 and then called a function that made it log that variable in the console.  That's why the 42 is logged there.</p>

<script> myNumber = myNumber + 10
console.log(myNumber + 10)
</script>
<p> You can manipulate variables with math.
    <br>
    String Variables:
    </p>

<script> 
var username = "Annalee" 

var myNumber = 20;
var bigNumber = myNumber > 100;
console.log(bigNumber);
</script>

<p>
    Arrays
    a variable with multiple parts: full of strings.  Put value of each "thing" in array within the brackets separated by commas.  0-indexed. 0, 1, 2, 3....

    Double slashes: denote comment

    In the next example, the array being created is called USERS.  It's important to remember that arrays can hold multiple kinds of data points.

</p>

<script>
var users = ["Dave", "Dan", "Mengyue"];
console.log(users);
console.log(users[1]);
</script>

<p>
    Object Variables
    Curled bracket.
</p>

<script>
    var myObject = {
        name: "Annalee",
        color: "purple",
        };
console.log(myObject.name)

    var complexUser = {
        name: "Annalee",
        zip: 33647,
        color: "grey",
        dog: true,
        greet: function(greeting) {
    
            console.log(greeting + "Dave!")
                                    }
                        };

complexUser.greet("Goodbye");

console.log(complexUser.color);
 </script>


<script>
var myNumber = 12;

if (myNumber > 10) {
    console.log(Wow! Big Number!");
}
else {
    console.log("Not so big...");
}


var greaterThanTen = function(num) {

    if (num > 10) {
        console.log("Yes!");
    }
    else {
        console.log("noooo");
    }

    return num > 10;
}
var checkNumber = greaterThanTen(20);

console.log(checkNumber);
    }
    }
}
</script>

 <p>
     If a logic has to be repeated, make a function. It's like a CSS class.  You can avoid tedious clean up by letting one logic take care of the task.
 </p>

 <script>
 
 var sayHello = function(name) {
     console.log("Hello," + name);
 }

 sayHello("Dave");
 sayHello("Lisa");
 sayHello(complexUser.name)

     </script>

<script>
    var sayText = (txt)

    var plusTen = functoin(num) {
        return num + 10;
    }
